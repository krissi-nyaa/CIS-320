This repo was made for a class ;)

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- The test cases created help verify things such as security, input restrictions, and overall functionality based on the requirements for the project.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- Test cases were setup in parallel to the requirements gathering to ensure all requirements were properly incorperated into the code.
How do I approach designing software?
- I usually like to create the test cases first and detach the testing harness from the individual code files (i.e. don't just splat the tests inline to the code). I then setup nightly regression testing and automated reporting after each test to the relevant stakeholders. As the project moves along, the tests start passing and eventually we filter down to the last remaining tests that are blockers for finishing up the project.
